# PricePilot - For Educational Purposes Only

ðŸš€ **PricePilot - Your Vehicle Pricing Navigator (Educational Purpose)**

Welcome to PricePilot, a project developed for educational purposes, showcasing the integration of web scraping, data management, and predictive analysis. This project demonstrates how to scrape data from [https://www.lacentrale.fr/](https://www.lacentrale.fr/) and store it in a database, with a focus on predicting car prices using advanced AI algorithms.

## Disclaimer

This project, PricePilot, is intended for educational use only. It serves as a learning tool to demonstrate the concepts of web scraping, data storage, and machine learning. The data scraped from [https://www.lacentrale.fr/](https://www.lacentrale.fr/) is used for educational and demonstrative purposes, and adherence to the website's terms of service and policies is maintained.

**Note**: If this project is accessible via a GitHub repository, please ensure that it is used strictly for educational purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Project Overview

PricePilot is a tool designed to predict car prices based on various factors like brand, mileage, and more. It provides a simulated environment for learning about data science and machine learning, particularly in the context of vehicle pricing predictions.

## Setup Instructions

To set up PricePilot for educational purposes, follow these steps:

### 1. Configuration

- Copy the `.env.example` file into a new file named `.env` in both the project root and the `price-pilot` folder:

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  Fill in the necessary variables in the `.env` files. These files will hold important configuration information for your application.

### 2. Install Backend Requirements

- Ensure you have **Python 3.10** installed. If not, you can download it from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip in the project root:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Install Frontend Requirements

- Ensure you have **Node.js 18 or higher** installed. If not, you can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Navigate to the `price-pilot` folder and install the frontend dependencies listed in `package.json` using npm:

  ```bash
  cd price-pilot
  npm install
  ```

### 4. Database Configuration

- PricePilot uses MongoDB as the database. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running or use [MongoAtlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).

### 5. Run Migrations

- Run the database migrations to set up the initial database schema in the project root:

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

### 6. Run the Backend Server

- Start the development server in the project root:

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

### 7. Run the Frontend Server

- Start the frontend server in the `price-pilot` folder:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

ðŸ›« PricePilot is now ready for takeoff! Access the application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and explore the world of predicted car prices for educational purposes.
